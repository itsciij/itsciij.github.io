							<h3><strong>Measurables Campaign</strong></h3>


							<p>For the last half of my senior project, I worked with a group of graphic design and industrial design students for a branding campaign project. The product
								we branded was a set of dishwares called Measurables.
								My role was to lead the team in creating a style guide for the product, as well as design a landing page and a target market infographic.

							<h4><strong>Timeframe:</strong> </br> Nov 2016 (1 Month)</h4>
								<h4><strong>Tasks:</strong> </br>  Branding, Visual Design, Information Design, Illustration </h4>

							<h3><strong>Defining our Target Market</strong></h3>


							<p>The product designed by our industrial designers is specifically a multipurpose dishware that can be eaten out of, as well as measured accurately.
								Since our product's strength is in its modernity and multifunctionality, we geared our campaign towards college students, and the working middle class.
								Our group did a research on these people, as well as our potential competitors. I created a small infographic about our findings to present in class.

									<h3><strong>Style Guide</strong></h3>


									<p>Since I'm taking charge of the brand aesthetic, I also designed a style guide to make sure that the brand has a cohesive look across our online marketing collaterals.

				<h4> <strong>Color </strong> </br> We chose colors based on the food pyramid and neutralize them
				to give our brand a fresh, yet modern feel. The warm shades are used for our iconography and imagery
			because it's inviting, joyful and stimulates the appetite. Shades of teal are also used
			for highlights and buttons to balance everything out and evoke calmness and clarity. </h4>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="col-md-6   animate-box">
		<div class="main-content" >



						<h4> <strong>Typography </strong> </br> Since most of
						our images are geometric, we wanted a humanist sans-serif to give our brand an organic feel and ease the eyes of our viewers. Hind has a clear
					  form that makes our content look friendly, yet still professional. We also thought that it look good on both print and web.   </h4>

				<h3><strong>Marketing Landing Page</strong></h3>


				<p>Lastly, I designed a landing web page that will fulfill our viewer's needs. Our intention for this website is to inform
				 our first time visitors about Measurables and aslo be a starting page for them and our regular
			 visitors to buy our products. </p>

						<h3><strong>Design Decisions</strong></h3>


						<p>Before that, I did a lot of layout iterations. I know that I wanted to use bold imagery
						to attract attention. I also wanted the users to be able to quickly access our site's content
					immediately. I realized that using boxes are a bit jarring, and that I wanted our landing page <tbody>
					to have more drama and convey a story.
					</tbody></p>

											</div>
						</div>


						<div class="col-md-6  animate-box">
							<div class="main-content">
							</br>
								<h3><strong>Final Iteration</strong></h3>
								<p> I decided to divide the landing page into three main parts: </p>

									<ul>
										 <li>First is a dramatic hero
								with a short description about Measurables to attract our visitors into buying
							our product. </li>
							<li>For those who want to learn more about Measurables, the second part briefly tells about our products and our promise, while
						also showcasing all our dishwares through bold images. </li> <li>The last part gives our visitors a chance
					to subscribe to our newsletter. </li>  </ul>
							</div>
						</div>


						<div class="col-md-6  animate-box">
							<div class="main-content">
							</br></br>
								<img src="images/m-final.gif" class="img-responsive"> </img>
							</div>
						</div>

						<div class="col-md-8  animate-box">
							<div class="main-content">
							</br>
								<h3><strong>Takeaways</strong></h3>
								<p> With this project, I learned a lot about marketing concepts, as well as
								 the process of branding a product from scratch. Have I had more time with
								 working on the website, I would play around with other layouts, as well as do some actual
								 user testing to validate all my design decisions.




								 <p>I also learned about the value of team work and respect to one another. Working with other
								 designers as a team, we were able to help each other out with each of our tasks, give healthy feedback and use our
								 different experiences in creating a fun and collaborative environment.
               During the process of designing our campaign, we were able to assess all of our strengths and weaknesses in order
							 to assign specic tasks. Because we respect one another, we were able to give and take criticisms, have realistic goal-oriented discussions and
							 increase our productivity. Overall, I'm very grateful to have worked on this project.
